1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. Check the list of existing branches in local and remote
	git branch -a
	
3. Create new branch
	git branch mynewbranch (git branch <branch name>)
	
4. Again Check the list of existing branches. You can see our newly created branch in there. Green color branch is the current branch that we are working now

5. To move from master to mynewbranch, type
	git checkout mynewbranch
	
6. Now you can see mynewbranch is in green color because we are using it now.

7. Go back to master branch again.
	git checkout master
	
8. To rename your branch, type
	git branch -m mynewbranch newbranch (git branch -m <current branch name> <new name>)
	
9. If you want to delete a branch, type
	git branch -d newbranch (git branch -d <branch name>)
	
10. Remember cannot delete a branch that you are currently working on. You need to switch to different branch first.
