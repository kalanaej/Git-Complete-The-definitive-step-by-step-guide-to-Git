1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. If you change the same content in same file in master branch and any other branch, it will giving you merge conflicts when you are trying to merge both.

3. You can create and switch to new branch immediatly by using
	git checkout -b realwork
	
4. Edit simple.html file in add-copyright branch
	npp simple.html
	
5. Add and commit in the same time 
	git commit -am "Making changes to simple.html"
	
6. To pass those changes to master branch, first, switch to master
	git checkout master
	
7. Edit the simple.html in master branch
	npp simple.html
	
8. Add the changes
	git add simple.html
	
9. Commmit changes
	git commit
	
10. Now you cannot merge realwork branch with master branch because contents of both files are changed.
	git merge realwork
	
11. You can see you are in merging state. not in the master branch. (marster|MERGING)

12. Therefore, try to edit the simple.html in master merging area
	npp simple.html
	
13. You can see conflicts are show in the file. To resolve this use P4Merge tool.
	git mergetool
	
14. In the P4Merge tool you can click the color shape that you want to keep in future.

15. After resolving conflicts, commit the changes.
	git commit -m "Done resolving merge conflicts"
	
16. If you check the status you can see simple.html file shown as simple.html.orig file. It happens if we want to restore changes we can get that from that .orig file.

17. We can ignore that file extention using .gitignore
	npp .gitignore
	
	add -: *.orig
	
18. Add the changes of .gitignore and commit the changes.
	git add .gitignore
	git commit -m "Updating ignore file to exclude merge temp files"
