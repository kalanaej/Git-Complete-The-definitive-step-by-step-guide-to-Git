1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. If you want to ignore unwanted files or folders you need to have .gitignore file. If you don't have it, create it
	npp .gitignore
	
3. This file can contain three optons
	i) Specific file -: myfile.txt
	ii) File patter -: *.exe
	iii) Folder -: my-folder/
	
	line 1 -: .DS_Store
	
4. after adding a directory, save and close the .gitignore

5. Add changes to staging
	git add .gitignore
	
6. Commit the changes
	git commit
	
	line 1 -: Adding git ignore file to exclude unwanted files

7. Create new log file
	npp access.log
	
8. Add few lines in there. Then save and close it
	line 1 -: /index.html 200
	line 2 -: /somethingelse.html 404
	line 3 -: /hackattempt.html 500
	
9. To exclude access.log file go to .gitignore again
	npp .gitignore
	
	line 2 -: *.log (this will exclude all log files)
	
10. Create new log directory
	mkdir log
	
11. Move access.log inside log directory
	mv access.log log
	
12. Get a copy from access.log and rename it.
	cp access.log access.2014-11-04
	
13. We need to add log directory into .gitignore because we only excluded log files not directories.
	cd ..
	npp .gitignore
	
14. We need to exclude access.log file only and it is now store in log directory. Therefore *.log in .gitignore is unnessasary.
	line 2 -: remove " *.log "
	line 2 -: add " log/ "
