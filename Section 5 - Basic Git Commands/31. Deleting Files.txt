1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. Create a text file callled "doomed"
	npp doomed.txt
	
	line 1 -: This file won't last long
	
3. If we want to delete that file, git commands not work for deletion because we did not add that file to git yet. (check git status)

4. However, we can user OS commands to delete that file.
	rm doomed.txt
	
5. I you already added a file to the git, you can simply delete it by using
	git rm newfile.txt
	
6. After that commit the changes
	git commit -m "Deleting new file"
	
7. Now delete the hipster.txt
	git rm hipster.txt
	
8. It is now in stage area for complete deletion but if you want to undo the deletion, type
	git reset HEAD hipster.txt
	
9. Now, check the directory using "ls" command. You can see deleted file still not appear in project directory.

10. Check the status. You can see our file changes removed from staging area but it colored as red. We need to still restore that file. To do that type
	git checkout -- hipster.txt
	
11. Delete the hipster.txt file using OS commands
	rm hipster.txt
	
12. If we check status, it shows we delete the file and not added to staging. We can add that file into staging area by using
	git add -A
	
13. Commit the changes
	git commit
	
	line 1 -: Deleted hipster.txt file
	
14. Remove level1 directory that have sub directories and files using OS commands
	rm -rf level1
	
15. Add the changes to staging
	git add -A
	
16. Commit the changes
	git commit -m "deleting level1 and all the children"
