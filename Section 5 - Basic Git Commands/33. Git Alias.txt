1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. View decorated commmit history
	git log --all --oneline --graph --decorate
	
3. Above code is too long. If we want we can manual git command to dop that.
	
4. Create your own git command. If you type "git hist" it will show "There is no command hist in git". To make that happen we can use Alias
		git hist (not working)
		git config --global alias.hist "log --all --oneline --graph --decorate"
		git hist (now it is working)
		
5. To view our custome alias, open .gitconfig file
	npp ~/.gitconfig
	
6. You can see our hist command in there under ther alias category. If you want, you can edit things in alias there.
