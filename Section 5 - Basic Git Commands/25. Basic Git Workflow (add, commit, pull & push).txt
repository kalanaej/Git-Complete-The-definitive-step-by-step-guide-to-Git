1. Open git bash and navigate to starte-web repo.
	cd projects/
	cd starter-web/
	
2. Create new text file called "hipster".
	npp hipster.txt
	
3. New notepad++ file will open.

4. Now navigate to https://hipsum.co/. Then click "Beer me!" button. Copy the first paragraph and paste it on our text file. Save and close.

5. Now check the status of the repo
	git status
	
6. You can see hipster.txt is in red color because we did not add changes to repo.

7. Add the text file.
	git add hipster.txt

8. Commit changes
	git commit
	
9. If you only use "git commit" command, notepad++ file open and you can add commit message or message starting from line 1. Then save and close it.
	line 1 -: My first commit!
	
10. Update our remote repository by applying changes. (this method most suitable when we use branches)
	git pull origin master (git pull origin <branch name>)
	
11. Push the changes
	git push origin master (git push origin master)
