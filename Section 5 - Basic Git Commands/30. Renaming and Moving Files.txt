1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. Then go inside level3 directory
	cd level1/level2/level3/
	
3. Now rename the level3-file.txt using git command
	git mv level3-file.txt level3.txt (git mv <current file name> <new file name>)
	
4. Check the status
	git status
	
5. You can see changes are in green color. When we renaming file, it automatically add to the git. Therefore, no need to use "git add" command.

6. Therefore, commit the changes
	git commit -m "renaming level3 file"
	
7. Go back to level2 directory
	cd ..
	
8. Rename level2-file.txt using operating system level. (without using git)
	mv level2-file.txt level2.txt (mv <current file name> <new file name>)
	
9. Check the status
	git status
	
10. Now git recognize this as you deleted the level2-file.txt file and add new file called level2.txt (therefore, changes are show in red)

11. To show we rename the file without any deletion, we need to add this into git as
	git add -A
	
12. Commit the changes
	git commit
	
	line 1 -: Renaming level2 file
	
13. After you renaming a file using git command and you want to undo that renaming follow this
	rename -: git mv level2.txt 2.txt
	undo -: git mv 2.txt level2.txt
	
14. Move level2.txt into level3 directory.
	git mv level2.txt level3/ (git mv <your file> <move location>)
	
15. Go back to level2 directory and commit the changes
	cd ..
	git commit
	
	line 1 -: Moving file from level2 to level3

16. Move level2.txt from level3 to level2 directory using OS commands.
	cd level3/
	mv level2.txt ..

17. If we check the git status, it will show we delete the text file and create a new file. To prevent that type
	git add -A
	
18. Commit the changes
	git commit
	
	line 1 -: Moving level2 file back to level2 directory
	
19. Go back to level1 directory and rename the file manually (C:\Users\user\projects\starter-web\level1\level1-file.txt)  (Right click > rename)

20. Check the status
	git status
	
21. In here also, git detected the process as deletion and add new file. To prevent that we cannot use "git add -A". Therefore, to do that, type
	git add level1.txt (git add <new name>)
	git add -u
	
20. Check the status
	git status
	
21. Now it shows as you renamed the file, not deleted.

22. Commit the changes
	git commit
	
	line 1 -: Renaming level1 file
