1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. Edit simple.html file
	npp simple.html
	
3. Stash that change with a message
	git stash save "simple changes"
	
4. Edit index.html file
	npp index.html
	
5. Stash that change with a message
	git stash save "index changes"
	
6. Edit README.md file
	npp README.md
	
7. Stash that change with a message
	git stash save "Readme changes"
	
8. Now view the stash list. You can see multiple stashes their with messages that we set before.
	git stash list
	
9. You can see first stash message is the last stash that we have setuped.

10. If you want to view specific stash from list, type
	git stash show stash@{1}
	
11. Now, release selected stash from the list
	git stash apply stash@{1}
	
12. We do not want stash@{1} now because we released it. Therefore, we can drop it.
