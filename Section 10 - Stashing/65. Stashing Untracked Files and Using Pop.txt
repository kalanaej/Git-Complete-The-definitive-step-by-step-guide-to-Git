1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. Edit humans.txt file
	npp humans.txt
	
3. Create new text file.
	npp ANewFile.txt
	
4. If we use stash now, stash activate only for modified file (humans.txt). New file not added to stash. 
	git stash
	
5. You can examine that by using
	git status
	
6. Therefore, release the stash and delete it
	git stash apply
	git stash drop
	
7. If you want to add new text file and humans.txt into stash, Use
	git stash -u
	
8. Release the stash and drop it in same time
	git stash pop
	
9. Delete the new text file in OS level
	rm ANewFile.txt
	
10. Add and commit the changes into git
	git commit -am "After the stash pop"
