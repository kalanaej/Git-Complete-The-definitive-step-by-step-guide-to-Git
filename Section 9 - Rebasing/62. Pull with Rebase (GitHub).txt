1. Go to our repo
	cd projects/starter-web/
	
2. push the changes that we previously done so far
	git push origin master
	
3. Edit simple.html
	npp simple.html
	
4. Commit the changes
	git commit -am "local: updating simple.html"
	
5. Go to your Github account and edit index.html file in your starter-web project. Now you have two different versions in remote and local and remote is one -step a head from local.

6. To get remote updates to local, use fetch feature in git. Fetch is acting like commit in here.
	git fetch origin master
	
7. To apply changes we need to follow this. Now you can view remote updates can view from local repo
	git pull --rebase origin master
